            <h2><a href="#safer">How does SitePassword make me safer?</a></h2>
            <p>
              It's hard for people to remember a really strong password. It's
              impossible for them to remember a lot of them. SitePassword asks
              you to remember one strong password, but calculates a different,
              hard to guess password for each site. Plus, SitePassword never
              stores your passwords, which means you don't have to worry about
              your password file being stolen.
            </p>

          <section id="needed">
            <h2>
              <a href="#needed"
                >Why do I need to pick a strong master password?</a
              >
            </h2>
            <p>
              Let's say you use SitePassword to log into a web site with a
              couple of less than honorable employees. They have your userid and
              password for that site, and they can probably guess your sitename.
              With that information they can start guessing master passwords
              until they find one that gives your password for the site. Once
              the bad guys have a match, it's relatively easy for them to guess
              userids and sitenames at different sites until they get into your
              bank account and steal all your money. Using a strong master
              password will make it really hard for them to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing you can do to protect yourself from this guessing
              attack is to use different master passwords for general surfing
              and sites you want to protect, like your bank's. That way your
              money is safe even if bad guys get the master password you use for
              your favorite fly fishing site.

          <section id="everyone">
            <h2><a href="#everyone">What's this Everyone thingy?</a></h2>
            <p>
              That's a 'persona.' It lets SitePassword remember different
              sitenames and usernames for different people who share a machine.
              Say that you have a machine you leave logged in for your family to
              use. Each person probably has a different userid and password for
              the same site, such as Facebook. Without personas, SitePassword
              would only be able to remember one of them. Family members can
              replace 'Everyone' with their names, and SitePassword will
              remember all their site information.

              >
            </h2>
            <p>
              SitePassword doesn't store your master password the way it stores
              your site information. That means SitePassword only
              remembers your master password until you reload this page.
              SitePassword also forgets your master password if it or your
              browser is updated. You should also click More and make sure you
              didn't tell SitePassword to forget your master password every time
              you use it.

            </h2>
            <p>
              To save you a click SitePassword guesses when you're done entering
              your site information. Sometimes it guesses wrong because you left
              the page or closed the SitePassword popup without first clicking
              on the web site's password field. On the SitePassword web page,
              you have to click Remember.

            </h2>
            <p>
              There are a lot of ways to put a password field on the page. Some
              of them do a really good job of confusing SitePassword. Over time,
              that should happen less frequently.

              First go to Facebook.com and log in there. Then you won't have to
              enter your userid or password to log into other sites that support
              this kind of 'social login.' You can do the same for other
              'identity providers,' such as Google or Twitter.
