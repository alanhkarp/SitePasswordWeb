              <p>
                SitePassword.info is different from most password managers.  Instead of 
                storing your passwords, it calculates them from a single master password 
                and your nickname and user name 
                for the site.  That means you can get your password if 
                you remember those three things.  You can also save your settings, so 
                you don't have to remember them.
              </p>  
              <p>
                Since SitePassword doesn't store your passwords, there's no way
                you can use your existing passwords with it.  You will have to use 
                the web site's <em>Change Password</em> or <em>Forgot Password</em>
                feature on sites where you already have accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
                SitePassword.info is a companion to the SitePassord Chrome extension.
                In addition to remembering your settings, the extension synchronizes them 
                across your machines.

            <div id="masterpasswordp" style="display:none">
              <p>
                You should choose a strong master password, one with upper and 
                lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.  The stronger
                the better.  The reason is simple.  A bad guy who knows one site 
                password and can guess your nickname and user name for that site
                can start guessing master passwords.  You want to make that job 
                has hard as you can.
              </p>
              <p>
                SitePassword cannot retrieve your master password. 
                You should make sure it's something you won't easily forget.  You 
                might even want to write it down and keep the copy in a secure place.

            <div id="acceptablep" style="display:none">
              <p>
                Some web sites have strict password rules, how long it must be,
                if it must contain upper case or lower case letters, numbers, or
                special characters, including restrictions on which special
                characters are allowed.  If you run into a site that doesn't 
                accept the calculated password, click the <em>More</em>
                button and change the appropriate menu entries.  SitePassword 
                was tested on 100s of web sites to make sure it can always 
                compute a valid password.

            <div id="changep" style="display: none">
              <p>
                Some sites make you change your password periodically.  SitePassword
                makes that easy.  Just change your nickname for the site.  For example, 
                if your current nickname is <em>MyBank2021</em>, and they make you change 
                your password once a year, you could change the nickname to 
                <em>MyBank2022</em>.  Your new site password will be completely different 
                from the old one.

                SitePassword includes an antiphishing feature.  If you try to use 
                the same nickname for another domain name, you will get a big, 
                scary warning.  It's telling you that you may be at a site 
                spoofing the one you think you are at. Unfortunately, you will 
                also see this warning when you are not being tricked.  Many 
                websites have several different login pages with different domain 
                names.  So, when you see the warning, check the URL of the page 
                to make sure it's a login page for the site you think it is.

              <p>
                The SitePassword Chrome extension plays well with SitePassword.info. 
                In particular, the extension uses bookmarks to synchronize your 
                settings across machines.  Pasting the appropriate bookmark into 
                SitePassword.info fills in the form for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the domain name of the URL you pasted does not match that of the 
                bookmark you selected, you'll get a phishing warning.  It's telling you 
                that you may be at a site

                phone.  Of course, you won't be able to remember the settings until you 
                provide a domain name.  You can just make one up, <em>e.g., MyApp</em>, which 
                you'll use the next time you need a password for that app.
