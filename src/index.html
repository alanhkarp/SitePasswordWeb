            <p>
              It's too hard for you to remember a strong password for every
              site you use.  Password managers take care of this problem for 
              you.  Most of them store your passwords in encrypted form, either 
              on your machine or in the cloud.  
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword is different.  It calculates your password for the
              site from a single master password and your nickname and user name 
              for the site.  That means you can get your password if 
              you remember those three things.  Just go to 
              <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a> and 
              fill in the form.  There is also an extension for the Chrome 
              browser that you can install.
            </p>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section id="masterpassword">
            <h2><a href="#masterpassword">Your Master Password</a></h2>
            <div id="masterpasswordp" style="display:none">
            <p>
              You should choose a strong master password, one with upper and 
              lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.  The stronger
              the better.  The reason is simple.  A bad guy who knows one site 
              password and can guess your nickname and user name for that site
              can start guessing master passwords.  You want to make that job 
              has hard as you can.
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword cannot retrieve your master password. 
              You should make sure it's something you won't easily forget.  You 
              might even want to write it down and keep the copy in a secure place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since SitePassword doesn't store your passwords, there's no way
              you can use your existing passwords with it.  You will have to use 
              the web site's <em>Change Password</em> or <em>Forgot Password</em>
              feature on sites where you already have accounts.
            </p>
          </div>
          </section>
          <section id="common">
            <h2><a href="#common">Common Features</a></h2>
            <div id="commonp" style="display:none">
            <p>
              Using the <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a> 
              web page to compute a password is similar to the way you use 
              the Chrome extension.  In both cases, you fill in your master 
              password, nickname and user name for the site, and your  password 
              for the site is calculated for you.  The differences are 
              described in later sections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some web sites have strict password rules, how long it must be,
              if it must contain upper case or lower case letters, numbers, or
              special characters, including restrictions on which special
              characters are allowed.  If you run into a site that doesn't 
              accept the calculated password, click the <em>More</em>
              button and change the appropriate menu entries.  SitePassword 
              was tested on 100s of web sites to make sure it can always 
              compute a valid password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sites make you change your password periodically.  SitePassword
              makes that easy.  Just change your nickname for the site.  For example, 
              if your current nickname is <em>MyBank2021</em>, and they make you change 
              your password once a year, you could change the nickname to 
              <em>MyBank2022</em>.  Your new site password will be completely different 
              from the old one.
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword includes an antiphishing feature.  If you try to use 
              the same nickname for another domain name, you will get a big, 
              scary warning.  It's telling you that you may be at a site 
              spoofing the one you think you are at. Unfortunately, you will 
              also see this warning when you are not being tricked.  Many 
              websites have several different login pages with different domain 
              names.  So, when you see the warning, check the URL of the page 
              to make sure it's a login page for the site you think it is.
            </p>

          <section id="extension">
            <h2>
              <a href="#extension"
                >Using the Chrome Extension
              </a>
            </h2>
            <div id="extensionp" style="display: none">
            <p>
              After you install the Chrome extension and visit a page with a 
              login form, you'll see that the password field tells you to <em>Click SitePassword</em>.
              When you click on the SitePassword icon, you'll see a form like the 
              one at <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a> with the 
              domain name field filled in.  Enter your master password, an easy to 
              remember nickname for the site and your user name for the site.  You 
              will see your site password being calculated as you type.  Mouse over 
              to the site's password field, which now should tell you to <em>Click 
              here for password</em>.  Click, and your password gets filled in.  
            </p>
            <p>
              When you reload the page, you'll see your user name filled in and 
              instructions to <em>Click here for password</em>.  If it says, 
              <em>Click SitePassword</em>, you will have to enter your master
              password again.  That's because SitePassword never stores your 
              master password; it only remembers it for the duration of your 
              browser session.  If your settings aren't there when you think 
              they should be, reloading the page with the login form will 
              solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you go to the same web page on a different machine that you
              synchronize bookmarks with, you'll see your nickname and user name for  
              the site filled in for you.  That's because the extension stores your
              settings in a bookmark folder called <em>SitePasswordData</em>.
              The extension uses the bookmarks with numeric titles, <em>e.g.,
              </em> "0", "1"<em>, etc</em>.  The bookmarks with domain names for 
              titles are for use on <a href="https://sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some pages have more than one password field, such as those for 
              creating an account or changing your password.  In those cases,
              you may see instructions to <em>Paste your password here</em>.
              Clicking on the SitePassword icon and then your site password will put 
              your site password on the clipboard.  After you're done pasting it, 
              you should copy something else so your password isn't on the 
              clipboard any longer than necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword is able to find the password field on all of the more than 100
              sites it's been tested on.  If the instructions don't show up in 
              the site's password field, and holding the mouse over it for a few
              seconds doesn't show a popup with the instructions, try clicking a blank 
              spot on the page.  If that doesn't work you can always click the 
              SitePassword icon and manually copy your site password to the clipboard. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you click the <em>More</em> button, you'll see an <em>Instructions</em>
              button.  Clicking it will take you to this page.
            </p>
            <p>
              You might feel uncomfortable having your master password available for 
              your entire browser session, say when you walk away from your machine for 
              a few minutes.  The <em>Clear master password on use</em>
              checkbox avoids this risk. Of course, you'll have to enter your 
              master password every
              time you need a site password.  There is also a risk to this choice; you 
              are more likely to have a keylogger that can capture your master password
              running the longer your browser session lasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a <em>Download Site Data</em> button at the bottom of 
              the page.  Clicking it lets you save your settings in a file you 
              can reference if you're at a machine that doesn't have your 
              SitePassword settings. This data doesn't contain anything that would 
              seriously compromise your security if it got exposed, but you shouldn't 
              publish it widely.

              There are times when you can't use the SitePassword extension, such
              as on a smart device that doesn't support browser extensions, when you're on 
              a friend's machine, or you're using a different browser.  In 
              those cases you can open <a href="sitepassword.info">SitePassord.info</a>
              and fill in the form manually.  If you would like to skip this step 
              in the future on this machine, click the <em>Remember</em>
              button.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="sitepassword.info">SitePassword.info</a> 
              can use bookmarks created by the extension to automate filling in 
              the form.  If you are logging into a web site, paste the URL of
              the login page into the domain name field.  Your site name and 
              user name fields will be filled in if you had previously remembered 
              this domain name.  If those fields aren't populated, find the appropriate bookmark in the 
              <em>SitePasswordData</em> bookmark folder, and paste it into the top field 
              on the form.  You will see the site name and user
              name fields get filled in.  
            </p>
            <p>
              If the domain name of the URL you pasted does not match that of the 
              bookmark you selected, you'll get a big scary warning.  It's telling you 
              that you may be at a site 
              spoofing the one you think you are at. Unfortunately, you will 
              also see this warning when you are not being tricked.  Many 
              websites have several different login pages with different domain 
              names.  So, when you see the warning, check the URL of the page 
              to make sure it's a login page for the site you think it is. 

            </p>
            <p>
              You can calculate your password without 
              providing a domain name, say to get the password for an app on your smart 
              phone.  Of course, you won't be able to remember the settings until you 
              provide a domain name.  You can just make one up, <em>e.g., MyApp</em>, which 
              you'll use the next time you need a password for that app.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a <em>Download Local Data</em> button at the bottom of 
              the page.  Clicking it lets you save your settings in a file you 
              can reference if you're at a machine that doesn't have your 
              SitePassword settings. <b>Only settings for sites you've chosen
              to remember on this machine will be included.</b>

              Many households have one machine shared by everybody.  It's likely that 
              everyone uses the same user name and password for certain sites, such as 
              streaming services.  It's also likely that those people use their individual
              usernames and passwords for other sites, such as social media. 
            </p> 
            <p>
              SitePassword accomodates those uses with a feature provided by Google 
              called <em>profiles</em>.  Each profile gets its own bookmarks and local 
              storage.  Simply create one profile for the shared account and one for each 
              individual.

              If you are worried that SitePassword might go away, you can download the source code for the extension from 
              the <a href="https://github.com/alanhkarp/SitePassword">SitePassword</a> project and that of this page from 
              the <a href="https://github.com/alanhkarp/SitePasswordWeb">SitePasswordWeb</a> project.  
              (For historical reasons, these are separate projects with a lot of duplicated code.)
