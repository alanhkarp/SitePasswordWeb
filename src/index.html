            <p>
              It's too hard for you to remember a strong password for every
              site you use.  Password managers take care of this problem for 
              you.  Most of them store your passwords in encrypted form, either 
              on your machine or in the cloud.  
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword is different.  It calculates your password for the
              site from a single master password and your nickname and username 
              (userid) for the site.  That means you can get your password if 
              you remember those three things.  Just come to 
              <a href="https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">SitePassword</a> and 
              fill in the form.  There is also an extension for the Chrome 
              browser that you can install.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="common">
            <h2><a href="#common">Common Features</a></h2>
            <p>
              Using the <a href="https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">SitePassword</a> 
              web page to compute a password is similar to the way you use 
              the Chrome extension.  In both cases, you fill in your master 
              password, nickname and user name for the site, and your  password 
              for the site is calculated for you.  The differences are 
              described in later sections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some web sites have strict password rules, how long it must be,
              if it must contain upper case or lower case letters, numbers, or
              special characters, including restrictions on which special
              characters are allowed.  If you run into a site that doesn't 
              accept the calculated password, click the <em>More</em>
              button and change the appropriate menu entries.  SitePassword 
              was tested on 100s of web sites to make sure it can always 
              compute a valid password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sites make you change your password periodically.  SitePassword
              makes that easy.  Just change your nickname for the site.  For example, 
              if your current nickname is <em>MyBank2021</em>, and they make you change 
              your password once a year, you could change the nickname to 
              <em>MyBank2022</em>.  Your new site password will be completely different 
              from the old one.
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword includes an antiphishing feature.  If you try to use 
              the same nickname for another domain name, you will get a big, 
              scary warning.  It's telling you that you may be at a site 
              spoofing the one you think you are at. Unfortunately, you will 
              also see this warning when you are not being tricked.  Many 
              websites have several different login pages with different domain 
              names.  So, when you see the warning, check the URL of the page 
              to make sure it's a login page for the site you think it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since SitePassword doesn't store your passwords, there's no way
              you can use your existing passwords with it.  You will have to use 
              the web site's <em>Change Password</em> or <em>Forgot Password</em>
              feature on sites where you already have accounts.
            </p>

          <section id="extension">
            <h2>
              <a href="#extension"
                >Using the Chrome Extension
              </a>
            </h2>
            <p>
              After you install the Chrome extension and visit a page with a 
              password field, you'll see that it tells you to <em>Click SitePassword</em>.
              When you click on the SitePassword icon, you'll see a form like the 
              one at <a href="https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">SitePassword</a> with the 
              Domain Name field filled in.  Enter your master password, an easy to 
              remember nickname for the site and your user name for the site.  You 
              will see your site password being calculated as you type.  Mouse over 
              to the site's password field, which now should tell you to <em>Click 
              here for password</em>.  Click, and your password gets filled in.  
            </p>
            <p>
              When you reload the page, you'll see your user name filled in and 
              instructions to <em>Click here for password</em>.  If it says, 
              <em>Click SitePassword</em>, you will have to enter your master
              password again.  That's because SitePassword never stores your 
              master password; it only remembers it for the duration of your 
              browser session.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you go to the same web page on a different machine which you
              synchronize bookmarks with, you'll see your nickname and user name for  
              the site filled in for you.  That's because the extension stores your
              settings in a bookmark folder called <em>SitePasswordData</em>.
              The extension uses the bookmarks with numeric titles, <em>e.g.,
              </em> "0", "1"<em>, etc</em>.  The bookmarks with domain names for 
              titles are for use on <a href="https://sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">SitePassword</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <em>Forget</em> button allows you to delete the settings for a 
              site you didn't mean to use.  For example, you may have created
              settings for the wrong web site, which might lead to confusion a 
              year in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some pages have more than one password field, such as those for 
              creating an account or changing your password.  In those cases,
              you may see instructions to <em>Paste your password here</em>.
              SitePassword has already put your site password on the clipboard
              and will remove it in a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
              SitePassword is able to find the password field on all of the hundreds
              of sites it's been tested on.  If the instructions don't show up in 
              the site's password field, and holding the mouse over it for a few
              seconds doesn't show a popup with the instructions, try clicking a blank 
              spot on the page.  If that doesn't work you can always click the 
              SitePassword icon and manually copy your site password to the clipboard. 
            </p>
            <p>
              If you click the <em>More</em> button, you'll see and <em>Instructions</em>
              button.  Clicking it will take you to this page.
            <p>
              There is a <em>Download Site Data</em> button at the bottom of 
              the page.  Clicking it lets you save your settings in a file you 
              can reference if you're at a machine that doesn't have your 
              SitePassword settings. This data doesn't contain anything that would 
              seriously compromise your security if it got exposed, but you shouldn't 
              publish it widely.

              The SitePassword <a href="sitepassword.alanhkarp.com">web page</a>

              SitePasswordData bookmark folder, and paste it into the top field 
              on the form.  You will see the domainname, site name, and user
              name fields get filled in.  If you would like to skip this step 
              in the future on this machine, click the <em>Remember</em>

              Alternatively, you can paste the site's domain name into the form.  Your

              sitenames and usernames for different people who share a machine.
              Say that you have a machine you leave logged in for your family to
              use. Each person probably has a different userid and password for
              the same site, such as Facebook. Without personas, SitePassword
              would only be able to remember one of them. Family members can
              replace 'Everyone' with their names, and SitePassword will
              remember all their site information.
